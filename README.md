# HTML-Portfolio
Welcome to My First Website!
This is my very first step into web development, created as part of Angela Yu's Complete Web Development course. Through this site, I'm exploring the basics of HTML, CSS, and creating responsive layouts, all hosted here on GitHub. I'm excited to share my progress and look forward to building more interactive and dynamic websites in the future. Thanks for stopping by, and feel free to follow my journey as I dive deeper into web development!
